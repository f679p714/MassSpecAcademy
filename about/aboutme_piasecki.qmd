I am a research geologist at the U. S. Geological Survey in Denver, CO. I develop new mass spectromectric methods for small samples, rare species, and new instruments and compare that to a theoretical quantum mechanical based framework. I have applied this to topics such as critical minerals and mine waste as a resource, non-conventional oil and gas reserves, glaciation of Antarctica, and modern biogenic fluxes of methane to the atmosphere.

Keywords:

    - mass spectrometry 
    - instrumentation 
    - isotope geochemistry
    - stable isotopes
