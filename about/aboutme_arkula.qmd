I am a PhD student at University of Maine working on in situ Rb-Sr dating of micas using LA-ICP-MS/MS. My PhD work includes understanding the analytical chalenges (e.g., down hole fractionation) during Rb-Sr measurements and applying on tectonized rocks to understand the Rb-Sr system. Before my PhD, I did my BSc in Geological Engineering at Istanbul University and MSc in Earth, Structure and Dynamics at Utrecht University.
