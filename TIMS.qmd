# TIMS {#sec-TIMS}

## TIMS designs {#sec-TIMS-designs}

There's a list of ingredients in the components chapters. Here is the general recipe for a TIMS:

- sources are mostly the same (some brand differences, one vs. several filaments)
- short vs. long ion optics lens stacks
- just a magnet
- magnet + ESA
- a mix of faradays and/or electron multiplication systems
- other components: retardation filter, zoom optics
- high vacuum (turbo backed by dry scroll/rotary/piston)
- high vacuum bits: ion pumps, TSPs, ion gauge.
- 

## Making ions {#sec-TIMS-making-ions}

- how we get samples on filaments. emitters, sample loading schemes (triple filament with an evaporation filament and an ionization filament). Silica gel + phosphoric or graphite or tantalum oxide or etc. 
- What determines which of these schemes gets used? Work function, first ionization potential, other concerns (electrochemistry of glasses). Dark arts and magic.
- Langmuir and Langmuir-Saha equation, filament temperature, controls on ionization efficiency vs. ionization rate. Note we should ignore Carlson here.
- positive and negative ions (osmium and boron?)
- Warmup, stepwise heating, evaporation and fractionation of sample. Considerations in how to load and adjust the temperature.
- Periodic table with positive vs. negative ions, another with first ionization potentials. 
- Cavity sources

## Steering ions {#sec-TIMS-source-ion-optics}

- Lens stacks are mostly the same, accelerating voltages near 8-10 kV. 
- Defining slit sizes are in the 0.3 mm range.
- TIMS tend to use low resolution

## Analyzers {#sec-TIMS-analyzers}

- Magnetic sector, usually with extended geometry. 
- Laminated vs. wrapped electromagnet. Speed vs. cooling.
- ESF sometimes (OG S54)
- More magnets are possible, not often used outside nuclear operations

## Detectors {#sec-TIMS-detectors}

- Can have just one collector, but usually multicollector setup.
- Faradays often large, 1 mm opening slit, movable, equipped with suppressors and porous graphite insert. 
- Electron multipliers (one or many), analog or ion counting

### Amplification systems {#sec-TIMS-amplifiers}

- Resistive vs. Capacitive Trans-Impedence Amplifiers (see also NGMS)
- $10^{10}$ to $10^{13}$ $\Omega$ amplifiers for resistive.
- ATONA and older capacitive systems.

## TIMS methods {#sec-TIMS-methods}

- Dynamic vs. static methods
- Single collector methods

## Vacuum systems {#sec-TIMS-vacuum-systems}

- TIMS need high vacuum in general
- Source has a turbo backed by a dry rough pump.
- Analyzer side has ion pumps, plus maybe a TSP.
- Pirani and ion gauge on the source, separate ion gauge on the analyzer.
- High vacuum considerations for TIMS sources --- samples must be "smoked" or dried down, no low-temp volatile compounds, 

## Other components {#sec-TIMS-other-components}

- retardation lens useful for peak tailing problems
- zoom optics makes for multidynamic measurements without peak top position compromise
