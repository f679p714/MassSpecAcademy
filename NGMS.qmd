# NGMS

Noble gas mass spectrometry

## Overview

* Focus on sector instruments

* Also mention other platforms that are less commonly used to measure NG

## Gas Exraction and Sample Preparation

* Generic processes of cleaning up a sample
    - actual gas extraction
    - valves
        - manual
        - automated
    - gas cleanup
        - gettering
        - cryogenic separation
    - isotope dilution
    - gas standards and how to prepare them
        - depletion
    -volume considerations (& design)

## Noble Gas Mass Spectrometer System

* Nier-type source
    - Cathode variety
    - Source parameters and tuning
* Magnetic sector
    - Geometries
    - Physical tuning of the magnet
    - Magnet hysteresis
* Electric sectors
* Collectors
    - Types of detectors 
    - Single collector instruments
    - Multi-collector setups
        - Flight tubes (split or not)

## Vacuum Considerations

* Need for UHV
    - Material considerations
    - Cleanliness
    - Memory effects
    - Baking

## Peak Shapes

* Beam focusing and steering
* Isobaric interferences & mass resolution considerations

## Time-zero and isotopic evolutions

* Why time-zero in the first place
* Theoretically what isotope evolutions should look like
* Different strategies for curve fitting
